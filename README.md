Some codes to generate crystalline lattice structures in 2D. Lattice structures are tesselations of the 2D grid (R^2) by a polygon, the most famous of which are square and hexagons.

## Hexagonal and Square Lattices
Why do people care about these guys? Well, for example the hexagonal lattice structure corresponds to the 2D projection (or flattening) of the molecular structure of a very famous chemical compound called graphene. 


Graphene is having its heyday now; due to its atomic structure, the material has a plethora of special properties associated with it. There exist edge states that are <it> topologically-protected</it>, so that perturbation by a symmetry-breaking potential (given certain conditions) still elicits the special properties associated with the material-- that is, the structure makes the material <it> robust</it> in a particular way. 

Mathematical theory around some of the behavior physicsts are able to observe experimentally has just been coming out, starting in the US With Professors Michael I Weinstien (Columbia University) and Charles Fefferman (Princeton University) in their 2012 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.3839.pdf">"Honeycomb Lattice Potentials and Dirac Points."</a> They,  with James Lee-Thorp (PhD Columbia, postdoc NYU) and Alexis Drouot (postdoc Columbia) have continued to push the boundary.


I also published with Michael, Jeremy Marzuola (UNC Chapel Hill) and Braxton Osting (University of Utah) on the square and Lieb lattices: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06812.pdf">"Spectral band degeneracies of (pi/2)-rotationally invariant
periodic Schroedinger operators."</a>
